## Telecom Churn Case Study
### Business Problem Overview
In the telecommunications industry, customers have the freedom to select from various service providers and frequently switch between operators. Within this fiercely competitive market, the telecom sector typically witnesses an annual churn rate ranging from 15% to 25%. Recognizing that acquiring new customers incurs costs that are 5 to 10 times higher than retaining existing ones, customer retention has emerged as a pivotal focus in contrast to customer acquisition. For numerous established operators, preserving highly profitable customers stands as a top-tier business objective. To mitigate customer churn, telecom companies must proactively anticipate which customers are most susceptible to churning. In this project, you will scrutinize individual customer data from a leading telecom company, construct predictive models to pinpoint customers with a heightened likelihood of churning, and identify the key indicators of churn.
## Understanding and Defining Churn
The telecom industry operates with two primary payment models: postpaid, where customers settle their bills monthly or annually after using the services, and prepaid, where customers prepay or recharge their accounts with a specific amount before utilizing the services. In the postpaid model, when customers intend to switch to another provider, they typically notify their current operator to terminate the services, making it evident that this is a case of churn. However, in the prepaid model, customers looking to switch networks can simply cease using the services without prior notice. This situation makes it challenging to ascertain whether someone has genuinely churned or is temporarily not utilizing the services, such as during an extended trip abroad with plans to resume service later. As a result, predicting churn is notably more crucial and complex for prepaid customers, necessitating a precise definition of the term 'churn.'
Furthermore, it's important to note that prepaid is the predominant model in India and Southeast Asia, while postpaid is more prevalent in Europe and North America. This project is centered around the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, where the prepaid model holds prominence.
